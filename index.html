          <h3>Donald Trump Paper</h3>
          <p>Burns, Alexander. "Donald Trump's Instinct for Racially Charged Rhetoric, Before His Presidential Bid. The New York Times.
          The New York Times, 31 July 2015. Web. 31 Aug. 2015.</p>

          <p>In an article by Alexander Burns of the New York Times, Burns reminds us of Trump's past use of very questionable rhetoric.
          Burns gives an informative and factual tone by providing many pieces of evidence regarding Trump's radical views on race and
          immigration and his campaigns that are used for the benefit of himself and his company. A more cynical tone comes out in a few
          places throughout the article where Burns uses diction to describe his distrust in the motives of Trump.</p>

          <p>Burns begins the article by describing an ad opposing the building of a casino. Describing the ad, he says "Under a dark
          photograph showing hypodermic needles and drug paraphernalia, the newspaper advertisement warned in dire terms that violent
          criminals were coming to town.". This description of the ad adds to the cynical tone of the article by giving a darker theme
          to Trump's advertisements.</p>

          <p>The little bias Burns does show can been seen when he gives an over-the-top introduction to Trump by saying â€œIt was only later that
          the man who bankrolled the ads identified himself: Donald J. Trump.".</p>

          <p>He then follows with small descriptions of Trump's mini-campaigns to profit. Later, he gives short descriptions of his evidence, he
          describes Trump's campaigns in depth with attention detail as well as bias. All of these descriptions contributed to the factual and partially
          objective tone of the article.</p>

          <p>In the majority of the writing, Burns gives clearly stated facts will little evidence of bias. He word choices are not quite scholarly but
          are aimed at a more educated audience. He uses words like "branded", "provocateur" and "pugnacious" to describe Trump and his actions. As well
          as "indignant" and "foray" to describe people's reactions to Trump's campaigns. These words are both accurate and more advanced.</p>

          <p>Referring to his evidence as "episodes", Burns creates the assumption that Trump's actions are related to each other and purposed. Giving
          a more cynical tone to the piece. This also shows when Burns says "He has used decisive rhetoric to advance his business interests...".</p>

          <p>While Burns does include many pieces of evidence proving his point that Trump's past actions may make us question his legitimacy as a
          presidential candidate, he also omits almost everything regarding Trump's financial knowledge or radical ideas that many see as good. Burns
          cites sources such as Jonathan C. Moore, who was the lawyer for the four convicted Central Park Rapists, as he said that Trump had an "incredible
          lack of judgement". In one section of the article, Burns does give Trump a defense by saying "Mr. Trump acknowledged that his style can be
          offensive to some, but he defend it as essential for communicating his message." This defense shows the more objective tone of the piece. However,
          this tone is only directly found in a few excerpts.</p>
