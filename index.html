          <b><h3>Immigration, Germany, and the Gilded Age</h3></b>

          <br>
          Between 1870 and 1920, roughly 1.7 million Germans left Germany and immigrated to the United States of America in search of freedom, liberty, and happiness. They faced many challenges along the way and even faced challenges after their arrival in America. For some, America brought success, for others, poverty, and for many, it brought hope.
          <br>
          In the late 1800s, Germany was run by Friedrich Ebert. Ebert was very controlling, and normal German citizens were quickly losing political power. The country was extremely poor and living conditions there were terrible. More than 300 years earlier, Germany had gone through a series of religious wars. These wars were caused by the creation of Protestantism, a new branch of Christianity. After Martin Luther started the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic church was outraged and waged wars in Germany, where as much as one third of the German population died. Because of those wars, Germany became very divided and there continued to be immense amounts of religious oppression throughout the country. This religious oppression was one of the main push factors for Germans. In 1683 a group of German families had moved to Pennsylvania, which was then an English colony, to escape religious oppression. This earlier immigration played a role in the larger wave of immigration that started many years later.
          <br>
          While Germany fell deeper into political and economic turmoil, causing the quality of life to drop drastically, America was rising out of the ashes of the Civil War and entering the global economy with the industrial revolution. This period of time between 1870 and 1920 was called the Gilded Age and was one of the major pull factors for immigrants. During the Gilded Age, America glorified itself by showing the technological advancements and their inventors, rather than the people who mass produced these new inventions. This glorification led to many myths about American society, and these myths quickly spread throughout Europe, creating a massive flow of immigrants to the U.S. Due to all of these combined factors, along with a history of emigration, many Germans made the decision to leave their beloved homeland in search of a new life.
          <br>
          To leave Germany, many immigrants had to walk to a port in either the northern part of Germany or to France to get on a boat. There was very little transportation technology then and most of the people immigrating did not have enough money to afford even the cheapest transportation.
          Once the Germans were on the boat, they faced a cold three- to four-week journey in the lower decks of a ship. These decks are called steerage. Within steerage, there would be thousands of immigrants crowded together in complete darkness. There were no windows, and thus no fresh air. Some boats would have tiny decks called steerage decks. Immigrants would be allowed on these decks but it would often be too cold to be outside.
          During the crossing, many immigrants died of disease or froze to death. The combination of horrific conditions, extreme weather, and overcrowding made it almost impossible to not get sick during the journey.
          <br>
          Most immigrants from Europe arrived in New York or Baltimore, with the majority coming into New York, through Ellis Island. Ellis Island was known as the “island of tears” by many immigrants because of the stories of those who were deported. Once the immigrants got off the boat, they would enter the main processing building. In this building they would have several inspections and an interview. If they passed everything, they were admitted. The inspection included a medical check, where doctors would make sure they had no serious diseases, a legal check, where a series of judges would make sure the person was not a criminal nor did they have anything illegal on them. The immigrants would then move to a baggage check, a money exchange, and finally an interview. The interview was one-on-one and involved 29 basic questions.
          Once they arrived in America, many immigrants stayed in New York, while others moved west into cities such as Milwaukee, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. These three cities were known as the “German triangle” because of their large German populations and their geographical triangular relationship. The majority of immigrants were unskilled farmers who came from the German countryside, hoping for a better life. When they arrived in New York, they found no suitable work, and moved west in search of a more familiar lifestyle. Of the Germans who stayed in New York, some were skilled laborers who were able to find jobs in their field, and others worked in factories. So many Germans moved to the lower east side of New York that it was known as “Kleindeutschland” or “Little Germany”. Living in Little Germany allowed Germans to share culture with fellow countrymen, as well as get help from people who spoke German but had been living in New York for a while. By 1894 there were 800 German newspapers nationwide. Many Germans were literate, but still occupied low level jobs that paid very little. These included cabinet makers, cigar makers, bakers, and tailors. Many worked twelve-hour work days with no breaks.
          <br>
          The majority of German immigrants moved to the midwest to work on farms. Although life on farms was difficult, there were many disadvantages of living in cities. In the late 1800s, the lower east side of New York was the most densely populated place on earth. Both poverty and overcrowding had massive effects on daily life. For a long time, New York did not have a sewage system, nor were there any building regulations on tenements, a cheap form of apartment that would typically be five to seven stories tall. With overcrowding and limited sanitation, disease spread extremely quickly, leading to the deaths of thousands.
          <br>
          After the start of World War I, nativism and racism against Germans increased because of America’s new relationship with Germany. The German immigrant population started to not talk about their culture, traditions, or about Germany at all, for fear of being harassed, beaten, or killed. After that, almost all of traditional German culture in America was lost.
          <br>
          Another way in which Germans were discriminated against was through religion. Since many “Americans” were strict Protestants, the majority of Roman Catholic or Jewish German immigrants were widely discriminated against.
          <br>
          Despite all the hardships faced by German immigrants, some of them did achieve the “American Dream”.  One example is Albert Einstein, a German immigrant who was extremely successful in math and physics. He discovered the mathematical laws that even today, define our universe. Another successful German was William G. Kerckhoff. Kerckhoff was born in Indiana to a German immigrant family but moved to California in 1879 in search of business opportunities. His first business in California was a lumber business, but he later went into hydroelectric power, water, gas, and land development. He was also one of the founders of Beverly Hills. He became extremely wealthy and built many buildings for universities including USC, UCLA, and CalTech. Throughout his life, Kerckhoff kept many ties to Germany: he went to high school there, he had heart treatments there, and he eventually died there.
          <br>
          The story that was heard by many Germans in their home country was that America had streets paved in gold, and that there was freedom for all and no discrimination. People also believed there was equal opportunity and it was very easy to become successful in America. While many of these stories were true in comparison to Germany, American life was not “easy”. There were many hardships faced by immigrants, and because America was still a developing country, it lacked basic laws, services, and infrastructure. However, in direct comparison to the country that they had left, which was so overpopulated it could not support its own people anymore, America was a much better option.
