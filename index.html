        <p>Late this year, I had a really important realization that affected my life greatly. I took control of my
        life in a way I had never had before, doing what I wanted to be done. From the time I was about eight, I have been playing piano.
        Until about seventh grade, that was my only hobby. However, in seventh grade, I started computer programming and getting really into it.
        In eighth grade, I stopped programming and started skateboarding, because it was cool, and programming was too "nerdy". In ninth grade,
        I started making electronic music, forgetting skating, programming, and piano, because they all weren't "cool". This continued until the
        beginning of tenth grade when I started having my realization.</p>

        <p>Tenth grade was a lot harder than ninth grade. I was taking an honors math
        class and a much harder Spanish class. I was also thinking a lot about college. I started a computer programming club with my friend, partly
        because I hoped it would look good on a college application. All of this academic pressure forced me to solely focus on school, completely
        ignoring my past hobbies. I thought they weren’t necessary, I thought I didn't have time for hobbies. This continued until late in the spring
        semester, when I had my big realization after wasting a ton of time one afternoon. I realized that without my hobbies, I was not happy,
        without my hobbies, I would do worse in school, I would get distracted more easily, I would waste time. Without my hobbies, I was a different
        person.So I decided to put effort into all of my hobbies. I would play piano everyday, I would code everyday, I would skate everyday, and
        I would make music everyday. At first it was hard. I would spend too much time on something and then not be able to do my homework, or vice
        versa. It took a couple of weeks to balance my priorities, but eventually, it worked. Now, I code everyday, I make music everyday, I skate
        everyday, and I play piano everyday.

        <p> To be able to take control of your life, and pursue something besides work or school, is an extremely
        important skill. I define this skill as agency, and without Galileo, I would never have learned about agency. Agency is ownership of your
        learning. It is being able to motivate yourself, do well, ask questions, turn in work on time, collaborate, and lead. If you have ownership
        of your learning, it allows you to take ownership of your life when it matters most. Galileo has taught me a lot in the two years that I have
        been in it. I have created my best academic work, and learned many important skills that I will be able to use for the rest of my life.
        I appreciate Galileo because not only did it teach me the regular curriculum, but it taught me about group learning, collaboration, leadership,
        and much more. After I understood agency, I became more focused and motivated, and was able to change the way I work both in and out of school.
        Next year will be very challenging but I will continue pursuing my hobbies and use the skills that Galileo has taught me to create a successful year.</p>
