            <p>Burns, Alexander. "Donald Trump's Instinct for Racially Charged Rhetoric, Before His Presidential Bid. The New York Times.
            The New York Times, 31 July 2015. Web. 31 Aug. 2015.</p>

            <p>In an article by Alexander Burns of the New York Times, Burns reminds us of Trump's past use of very questionable rhetoric.
            Burns gives an informative and factual tone by providing many pieces of evidence regarding Trump's radical views on race and
            immigration and his campaigns that are used for the benefit of himself and his company. A more cynical tone comes out in a few
            places throughout the article where Burns uses diction to describe his distrust in the motives of Trump.</p>

            <p>Burns begins the article by describing an ad opposing the building of a casino. Describing the ad, he says "Under a dark
            photograph showing hypodermic needles and drug paraphernalia, the newspaper advertisement warned in dire terms that violent
            criminals were coming to town.". This description of the ad adds to the cynical tone of the article by giving a darker theme
            to Trump's advertisements.</p>

            <p>The little bias Burns does show can been seen when he gives an over-the-top introduction to Trump by saying "It was only later that
            the man who bankrolled the ads identified himself: Donald J. Trump.".</p>

            <p>He then follows with small descriptions of Trump's mini-campaigns to profit. Later, he gives short descriptions of his evidence, he
            describes Trump's campaigns in depth with attention detail as well as bias. All of these descriptions contributed to the factual and partially
            objective tone of the article.</p>

            <p>In the majority of the writing, Burns gives clearly stated facts will little evidence of bias. He word choices are not quite scholarly but
            are aimed at a more educated audience. He uses words like "branded", "provocateur" and "pugnacious" to describe Trump and his actions. As well
            as "indignant" and "foray" to describe people's reactions to Trump's campaigns. These words are both accurate and more advanced.</p>

            <p>Referring to his evidence as "episodes", Burns creates the assumption that Trump's actions are related to each other and purposed. Giving
            a more cynical tone to the piece. This also shows when Burns says "He has used decisive rhetoric to advance his business interests...".</p>

            <p>While Burns does include many pieces of evidence proving his point that Trump's past actions may make us question his legitimacy as a
            presidential candidate, he also omits almost everything regarding Trump's financial knowledge or radical ideas that many see as good. Burns
            cites sources such as Jonathan C. Moore, who was the lawyer for the four convicted Central Park Rapists, as he said that Trump had an "incredible
            lack of judgement". In one section of the article, Burns does give Trump a defense by saying "Mr. Trump acknowledged that his style can be
            offensive to some, but he defend it as essential for communicating his message." This defense shows the more objective tone of the piece. However,
            this tone is only directly found in a few excerpts.</p>

          "What Happened in Ferguson?" The New York Times. The New York Times, 12 Aug. 2014. Web. 27 Sept. 2015.</p>

          <p>On August 8th, 2014, Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old from Ferguson, Missouri, was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police
          Department. Following the shooting, there was an investigation held by a grand jury where more than 60 witnesses testified against Wilson, with the final
          decision being not to indict him. This result sent a shockwave through the community and set off protests against the ruling. There were violent riots all
          across the nation that brought out the worst in both the riot police and the rioters. For the next year, the shock of both the shooting and the events that
          followed put police killings into the spotlight and heightened existing racial tensions, while failing to making significant progress.</p>

          <p>Racism towards black people in this country has deep roots. The United States was founded on racist values. Until Abraham Lincoln banned slavery, the United
          States fully supported the discrimination of another race. Over 200 years later, things have gotten a lot better. After the civil rights movement in the 1960s,
          racism in America was at an all time low. However, this shooting is evidence of remaining racial tensions.</p>

          <p>The jury's decision "prompted weeks of demonstrations and a response from the police that included tear gas and rubber bullets,"" the protests turned extremely
          violent with "at least a dozen buildings" set on fire. A violent reaction demonstrates the tension held about the issue of race in this country.
          Reactions towards racism in the United States commonly follow this path: huge, sometimes violent, reactions directly after an event that involves racism
          is put in the spotlight, and then very little permanent change. In the majority of cases after Michael Brown's, the police officer(s) involved were not
          convicted of any crime even though Brown's case sparked a massive discussion on race in the United States.</p>

          <p>A year after the shooting, it is evident that the killing of Michael Brown raised the level of racial awareness in this country but left a disproportional
          lasting impact. With the amount of violence that occurred in the aftermath of the shooting, the lasting impact of the events has not been proportionate.
          Discussions of race have already quieted, flaring up only directly after an event.</p>

          <p>As more police killings of black people such as Trayvon Martin, Christian Taylor,  Darius Graves and many others have come into the spotlight, progress in
          the fight against racism is slowly being made. Each one of these killings has made the next one have a slightly larger permanent effect on the fight against
          racism.</p>
